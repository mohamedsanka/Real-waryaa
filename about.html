<span>About Us – Real Waryaa.</span>
Welcome to Waryaa a fictional Co. – the streetwear brand that’s bringing Somali swagger to the fashion scene. Founded in 2024 by  “Waryaa”, our mission is simple: make clothes that look good, feel good, and make you walk like the street is your runway.
At real Waryaa, we follow the trends, but we add our own twist. From oversized hoodies with bold Somali proverbs, to graphic tees that mix street style with cultural pride, we design pieces that make people say “waryaa, where did you get that?”
We’re a small team working out of a cozy workshop in Mogadishu, but our designs travel far – from Hamarweyne to Helsinki. Every piece is made with care, quality fabrics, and just enough attitude to turn heads.
Our Vibe:
Streetwear meets Somali heritage
Limited drops so you’re always one step ahead
Styles inspired by real life, music, and global trends.
